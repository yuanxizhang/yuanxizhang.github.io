Gardening is one of my hobbies, I like to grow tomatoes, cucumbers and peppers in my garden. Building an app is a lot like growing a garden, you need to invest lots of time and overcome many obstacles before you can enjoy the fruit of your labor; you will not be able to learn everything about it by reading books, you need hands-on experience, you need to learn from your mistakes. The more apps you build, the more skills you pick up. 

Learning how to develop software is a process of finding solutions for your own problems or other people's problems.  First, you need to pick a problem to solve, this problem is some potential users' pain point.  and then you need to conduct user research and find out what features you app needs to have to solve this problem for its users, then build a web app and/or a mobile app to deliver these features and functions.

I like the article with the title "How to Become the Best Programmer in the World" on Hackernoon by Ohans Emmanuel. When the author reached out to Bill Sourour and asked him how to be the best programmer, he replied: "The basic answer is, to be the best at something you have to outwork everyone else who is also trying to be the best. That means code, read, learn, work at it every day and all the time.â€Š"
